Arduino-Teensy-MP3-lib
======================

Plays 320 kbps *.MP3 or *.AAC in software without external hardware - 
with only 48MHz.

Optimized for ARM Thumb2.

Currently, only basic-functionality is implemented.

planned:
 - *.m4u, *.mp4
 - *.flac
 
 - better interface

 TODO:
 - Check, if flash can be saved, there are some duplicate tables and functions in both decoders 
 - Optimize some functions
