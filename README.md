Arduino-Teensy-MP3-lib
======================

Plays up to 320 kbps *.MP3, *.MP4, *.M4A, or *.AAC in software without external hardware - 
with only 48MHz.

Optimized for ARM Thumb2.

Currently, only basic-functionality is implemented.

planned:
 - *.flac
 - better interface

 TODO:
 - Check, if flash can be saved, there are some duplicate tables and functions in both decoders 
 - Optimize some functions
